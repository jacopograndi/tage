fog: 
problem with undo:
1. undo and normal exploration allows for seeing and then undo the move
2. no undo when exploration is active
3. undo and exploration is updated only at the end of the day
4. undo and no fog (spies is useless)
problem with machine:
1. machine has to undo in order to think
2. machine does the turn without considering units out of sight
